# Image Upscaling using Fast Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (FSRCNN)

This project aimed to reproduce the results of the [Image Upscaling using CNN](https://github.com/guipleite/Image-Upscaling-CNN) repository. The objective was to implement and test an image upscaling model using Fast Super Resolution Convolutional Neural Networks (FSRCNN).

## Project Structure

- **Image Upscaling Using FSRCNN.ipynb**: This Jupyter notebook contains the complete code for the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **archive.zip**: This archive contains the dataset used for the project, organized into `ground_truth` and `images` folders for `train`, `test`, and `val` sets.

## Results

The results of the FSRCNN model will be displayed in the notebook, showcasing the performance on the validation set and visual comparisons of upscaled images against the ground truth.
